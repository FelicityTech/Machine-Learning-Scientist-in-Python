# Linear Classifiers in Python

Welcome to the **Linear Classifiers in Python** folder! This directory contains code, notes, and exercises related to linear classification algorithms, as explored in the [Datacamp Machine Learning Scientist with Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/machine-learning-scientist-with-python) career track.

## Overview

Linear classifiers are supervised machine learning algorithms that make predictions based on a linear predictor function. They are fundamental to understanding both classification and machine learning as a whole. Typical linear classifiers you will see here include:

- Logistic Regression
- Perceptron
- Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## What You'll Find Here

- **Notebooks and scripts** implementing and exploring linear classifiers
- **Example datasets** for practising model implementation and evaluation
- **Notes and explanations** covering key concepts, algorithms, and intuition behind linear classification
- **Worked exercises and solutions** to reinforce learning

## Key Topics

- Foundations of linear classification
- Model training & prediction
- Decision boundaries
- Performance metrics for classifiers
- Regularization and overfitting
- Comparison of linear classifiers

## Getting Started

To try out the code, you will need:
- Python (3.7+ recommended)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- (Optional) [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for visualization

Install dependencies using:
```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
